"911, what is your emergency?"
"Yeah, hi, um...This is going to sound kind of strange but there's a man stumbling around in circles in my front yard."


"...could you repeat that, sir?"
"He looks...sick, or lost, or drunk, or something. I just woke up to get a glass of water and heard snow crunching around underneath my front window so I peeked out...I'm looking at him now, he's about ten yards away from my window. Something's not right."
"What is your address, sir?"
"1617 Quarry Lane, in Pinella Pass."
"I'm going to send a squad car your way, but that's quite a ways out. Are you alone in your house sir?"
"Yes, I'm alone."
"Can you confirm that all of your doors and windows are locked? Stay on the phone with me."
"I know that my front is definitely locked, but I'll go check my back door again really quick.
...
I appreciate your help, by the way, I know this is kind of strange but I really hope that â€“"
