Sir?
...
...Sir? Are you still there?"
"He's...his face. It's up against the glass."
"Sir, I need you to speak up. What is happening?"
"I looked away for a split second and now...his face. It's pressed up against my front window. His teeth are huge and he's still smiling...There's no color in his eyes...Jesus please help me, why won't it just fucking move..."
"Sir, I need you to go to the nearest room and lock yourself inside of it. Do you have a basement or a bedroom that you can lock yourself in?"
